# README

Please review the scripts, these scripts were made to give people the general idea. Hopefully someone who knows how to properly build for these distributions can use them to create official packages.

Note: These were built on the latest 64-bit version of each system. It very well may have issues on 32-bit systems.

If you have another distribution you wish to add please contact us.
