# Baka MPlayer User Manual

## Introduction

Baka MPlayer is a free and open source, cross-platform, **libmpv** based multimedia player.
Its simple design reflects the idea for an uncluttered, simple, and enjoyable environment for watching tv shows.

## Features

### Playlist

The playlist is automatically populated by loading the files in the directory of the loaded file. If a folder is opened by drag and dropping it, the files in the immediate folder directory will be automatically populated (not including subdirectories).

### Gestures

Using a mouse or a touch screen, you can click and drag on the video to change playback.
Clicking and dragging left/right will seek backwards/forwards.
Clicking and dragging up/down will increase/decrease volume.
Gesture support can be disabled under Preferences if desired.

### Screenshots

The screenshot template is passed into mpv as `screenshot-template` (see mpv's manual for more info). If the screenshot dialog is hidden by unchecking the `Always show this dialog` option, the dialog can be restored by setting `baka-mplayer/screenshotDialog` to true in the settings file.

### Recent Files

Your recently viewed files are stored in settings for easy access. It is located at the bottom of the file under `[baka-mplayer] -> recent`. To store more recently viewed files, set the `[baka-mplayer] -> maxRecent` value and the list will trim itself accordingly.
